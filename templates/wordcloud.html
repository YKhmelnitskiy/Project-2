		`America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision for Xbox 360 , Playstation 3 and PC. It is the fourth installment in the Call of Duty video game series (excluding expansions), the first not to be set during World War II. It was announced on April 25, 2007. It was released on November 6, 2007 in North America, on November 7, 2007 in Australia, and on November 9, 2007 in Europe. The game also became available on Steam on November 6, 2007 for pre-purchase and is available to play as of November 12, 2007.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare introduces a variety of game play styles into the single player campaign completely new to the Call of Duty series. The game moves away from the standard three country-specific campaign style, and allows the plot to play through more like a film style plot with interlaced story lines from the perspective of the player as Paul Jackson, a member of the United States Marine Corps 1st Force Recon and Soap MacTavish, a member of the British 22nd SAS Regiment. There is also a variety of cameo-style missions where you play as various other soldiers such as an AC-130 Spectre Gunship gunner, or as one part of a two-man sniper team behind enemy lines in a flashback-style mission.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare focuses on the variation of modern warfare as an infantry soldier by allowing the player to control soldiers in a vast number of different scenarios, straying away from the constant straightforward action of previous Call of Duty titles and allowing for both heavy intensity fire fights and slower paced drama styled intensity. The series' move to modern warfare has also introduced a variety of new modern weapons and technology to be introduced to the Call of Duty franchise. Such showcased weapons and attachments include M203 grenade launchers, and the AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer for use in conjunction with night vision goggles, MP5SD submachine guns, the M4A1 Grenadier, and the FGM-148 Javelin portable anti-tank guided missile among many others.
Call of Duty: Black Ops III combines three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride. Multiplayer will be the franchiseÕs deepest, most rewarding and most engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its own dedicated narrative. The title ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved fluid movement system.
Call of Duty: WWII is the fourteenth main instalment in the Call of Duty series. The game was developed by Sledgehammer Games with help from Raven Software. The game is published by Activision and was released for the Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC on November 3rd 2017. 

Call of Duty: WWII takes the series back to the past while the last five Call of Duty games had futuristic setting. Call of Duty: WWII is also the first Call of Duty in three years to implement the boots on the ground movement system.

The base game includes a 6-8 hour campaign, a multiplayer mode and a zombies mode. 
Call of Duty : Black Ops takes you deep behind enemy lines into the world of deniable operations as a member of an elite special forces unit engaging in covert warfare, classified operations, and explosive conflicts across the globe.

Experience an uncensored edge to combat, as soldiers face the most harrowing and climactic European and Pacific battles in which an enemy, who knows no surrender and no retreat, fights to the last breath, unleashing an arsenal of lethal surprising tactics. Peril and danger lurk throughout the battlefield as players combat the unknown risk of the new chaos of battle.

Final battles: Play as a U.S. Marine or Russian conscript across a variety of European and Pacific infantry, vehicle and airborne missions. An all new depth of WWII-era combat variety, from the unique and varying locations that traverse the ruins of Western Europe to the harsh wetlands of Imperial Japan, immerses gamers into an adrenaline-filled, epic struggle.
Co-op campaign mode: No One Fights Alone takes on new meaning as players can complete the entire single player campaign with up to four players online or two players via split-screen (both online and offline). Complete unique co-op challenges to earn rewards and bragging rights. The title takes the perks, rankings and online stats players love in multiplayer, and builds them into the cooperative campaign, adding even more variety, replayability, and fun.
Multiplayer modes: Vehicles have been added to the multiplayer experience, featuring player rankings, upgradeable weapons, squad-based gameplay, map scripting, and customizable classes and perks.
Unprecedented WWII cinematic quality: Utilizing the jaw-dropping and revolutionary Call of Duty  4: Modern Warfareª engine, Call of Duty: World at War delivers an unprecedented level of visual and cinematic effects. Highly-detailed character models, self-shadowing, environmental lighting, and amazing special effects up the authenticity to new heights. Depth of field, rim-lighting, and texture-streaming technology bring the adrenaline-pumping combat to life. Physics-enabled battlefields and destructible cover immerse players into the harrowing and dynamic combat.
Developed exclusively for Xbox 360 by acclaimed developer Bungie, Halo 3: ODST is a stand-alone expansion that extends the award-winning Halo 3 experience with hours of new campaign and multiplayer gameplay.* The release adds a new dimension to an all-encompassing universe that gamers around the world have known and loved for more than six years.

The new campaign chapter predates the events that unfold in Halo 3 and gives players a new perspective through the eyes of a new hero in the Halo universe. New multiplayer maps ensure that the award-winning Xbox LIVE experience of Halo 3 continues to thrive.

Features: 

Top features include the following:

¥ All-new campaign content. The Halo 3: ODST campaign is an intriguing side story that takes place during the terrifying events leading up to the Master ChiefÕs return to New Mombasa in Halo 3. Experience the fate of Earth from the brand-new perspective of a special forces ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper), adding a unique outlook and new gameplay elements to the events that unfold in the trilogyÕs finale. While the feel of this new chapter will greatly resemble that of previous Halo experiences, Halo 3: ODST will require players to employ more elements of stealth and cunning than ever before.

¥ A new hero: Prepare to drop. Known for their courage, valor and, at times, insanity, ODSTs are among the fiercest UNSC soldiers, priding themselves on being the first unit deployed into hostile situations. While not as large or supernaturally gifted as their Spartan comrades, these Hell Jumpers more than compensate with their ferocious attitudes and unwavering nerve.

¥ Expanded multiplayer collection. No Halo experience would be complete without groundbreaking multiplayer content,* and Halo 3: ODST gives fans more of what they love. With exclusive new maps and full Forge options, players will find more multiplayer content than ever before with Halo 3: ODST.

Emerging from the underworld, Grand Theft Auto 3 dares to set new levels of unflinching criminal behavior in a dark, ruthless videogame that never pretends to be anything but truly adult entertainment. Make no mistake -- videogames have grown up, and GTA3 demonstrates that fully. Not only is the content severely mature -- how could a game putting you in the shoes of a mob gun-for-hire who has no qualms against hit orders, car jackings, or public use of heavy artillery not earn that M rating? -- but the game itself shows incredible leaps in production values to achieve that gritty reality. Hollywood talents such as Michael Rapaport, and Michael Madson give voice to the gangland thugs and Mafioso, while the PlayStation 2 super-charges GTA3's massive scale of crowded streets crammed with cars to steal. Liberty City is wide open to those who control it, and you're the kind of guy who makes his own key. In all seriousness, this game is rated Mature for a reason -- it's not for those under 17. Otherwise, they don't get much hotter than GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 ... if they know what's good for them.
From the decade of big hair, excess, and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, and is the most varied and complete digital city ever created. Combining nonlinear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with seedy opportunities and are given the chance to take it over as you choose. Take control of a variety of vehicles including high-performance cars and motorbikes, powerboats, golf buggies and helicopters. Browse through the radio stations, with styles ranging from rock to electro to find a sultry melody or pumping beat to suit your mood. No matter what type of man you are, Vice City is always full of surprises.
Halo: Reach, developed exclusively for Xbox 360 by acclaimed developer Bungie, is the blockbuster prequel to the best-selling Xbox franchise of all time. It represents the culmination of BungieÕs 10 years of experience crafting groundbreaking Halo games that have raised expectations for what can be achieved in a video game.

Experience the fateful moments that forged the Halo legend. This is the story of Noble Team, a squad of heroic Spartan soldiers, and their final stand on planet Reach, humanityÕs last line of defense between the terrifying Covenant and Earth. This darker story is echoed by grittier visuals amid a backdrop of massive, awe-inspiring environments. Characters, enemies, and environments are rendered in amazing detail by an all-new engine designed to deliver epic-scale encounters against the cunning and ruthless Covenant.

Once the campaign is over, the battle continues online with an unparalleled multiplayer experience expanding on the award-winning suite of features that helped define the Xbox LIVE experience.

The Halo: Reach multiplayer beta, on track to be the largest beta program of its kind on any console, is expected to see millions of participants when it begins May 3. Players can access the multiplayer beta on Xbox LIVE through the Halo 3: ODST disc.

Meet Noble Team: For the first time, players fight alongside a squad of iconic Spartan soldiers, each with deadly talents as unique as their individual personalities and customized gear.
An intense campaign: Live the events that set the stage for the Halo trilogy as the UNSC and Covenant clash at the height of their military power. New weapons and abilities complement the familiar Halo arsenal for the largest-scale battles ever witnessed in the Halo universe. Fiercely cunning artificial intelligence adds depth and complexity to each encounter, helping make every playthrough a unique and epic experience.
Stunning technical advancements: Halo: Reach takes a massive leap forward through all-new engine technology designed to take full advantage of next-generation graphics, audio, special effects, A.I., and animation while continuing to expand on the campaign, cooperative, and multiplayer sandbox in a way that only Halo can.
The definitive multiplayer experience: Halo: Reach builds on the success of its predecessors, setting a new standard for competitive gameplay, customization, variety and community integration.
Unparalleled feature suite: Halo: Reach expands on the industry-leading suite of features found in Halo 3, including four-player cooperative campaign play, splitscreen support, saved films, screenshots, and exciting new surprises that have yet to be revealed.
In Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines. As the first boots on the ground, players will experience heart-pounding missions across diverse locations including Paris, Tehran and New York. As a U.S. Marine in the field, periods of tension and anticipation are punctuated by moments of complete chaos. As bullets whiz by, as walls crumble, as explosions force players to the ground, the battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before.
